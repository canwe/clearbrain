/**
 * Provides controller classes to handle users' requests.
 * <p>
 * Classes from this package will handle HTTP requests, validate users' data, and will return model and views, according to what the user wants.<br />
 * For that, they may have to call several objects, such as <code>validators</code> or <code>business</code> objects.<br />
 * They are the first entry point of the application: when an HTTP request is received, <code>Spring MVC</code> will automatically dispatch it to a class from this package, according to the request type, or URL.<br />
