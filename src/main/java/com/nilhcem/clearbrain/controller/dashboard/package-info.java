/**
 * Provides dashboard related controller classes.
 * <p>
 * The dashboard is one of the main features of this project: it is a page summarizing everything the user should do.<br />
 * Dashboard controller classes, like any other controller classes, should call some <code>business</code> objects, validate and return data.<br />
 * There are different types of dashboards depending on what the dashboard should display <i>(for example, a dashboard can display only today/tomorrow's information.)</i>.<br />
 * However, it should be invisible for the user. Users should think there is only one type of dashboard, displaying different data depending on what they want.
